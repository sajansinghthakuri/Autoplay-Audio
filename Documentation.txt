# **Autoplay Audio with Countdown and Playback Speed Control**

This HTML document creates a webpage with an audio player that automatically plays a song after a countdown, and includes a playback speed control that allows the user to adjust the speed of the audio. The selected playback speed is stored in `localStorage`, so it persists across page reloads.

---

### **HTML Structure**

#### 1. **Meta Information**

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

* **`charset="UTF-8"`**: Defines the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which includes support for most characters in any language.
* **`name="viewport"`**: Ensures the page is responsive on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.).

#### 2. **Countdown Timer Section**

```html
<div id="hide">
  <h4>Audio Plays In</h4>
  <progress value="10" max="10" id="pageBeginCountdown"></progress>
  <p><span id="pageBeginCountdownText">5</span> seconds</p>
</div>
```

* **`<progress>`**: A progress bar element showing the countdown.
* **`<span id="pageBeginCountdownText">`**: Displays the remaining countdown time in seconds.
* **ID `hide`**: The countdown section is initially visible, and will fade out once the countdown is completed.

#### 3. **Audio Player with Speed Control**

```html
<div class="speedcontrolcontainer">
  <audio controls src="2002-anne-marie.mp3" id="my_audio" aria-label="Play Anne Marie's song"></audio>
  <div>
    <label for="pbrate">Speed:</label>
    <input type="range" id="pbrate" min="0.5" max="2" value="1" step="0.1">
    <span></span>
  </div>
</div>
```

* **`<audio>`**: An audio player element with playback controls. The audio source is set to `"2002-anne-marie.mp3"`.
* **Speed control**: A range input (`<input type="range">`) allows the user to adjust the playback speed from 0.5x to 2x.

  * The current playback rate is displayed inside the `<span>` element.

### **JavaScript Functionality**

#### 1. **Countdown Function**

```javascript
function ProgressCountdown(timeleft, bar, text) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const countdownTimer = setInterval(() => {
      if (--timeleft <= 0) {
        clearInterval(countdownTimer);
        $('#hide').fadeOut();
        resolve();
      }
      document.getElementById(bar).value = timeleft;
      document.getElementById(text).textContent = timeleft;
    }, 1000);
  });
}
```

* **`ProgressCountdown`**: This function manages the countdown logic. It takes:

  * `timeleft`: The initial time in seconds (e.g., 5 seconds).
  * `bar`: The `id` of the progress bar (`pageBeginCountdown`).
  * `text`: The `id` of the element displaying the countdown text (`pageBeginCountdownText`).
* The countdown updates every second (`setInterval`), and when the countdown reaches 0, it stops and hides the countdown section using jQuery's `.fadeOut()`. The promise resolves when the countdown is complete.

#### 2. **Start Countdown and Autoplay Audio**

```javascript
ProgressCountdown(5, 'pageBeginCountdown', 'pageBeginCountdownText').then(() => {
  document.getElementById("my_audio").play();
});
```

* Starts the countdown from 5 seconds. Once the countdown finishes, the audio player automatically plays the song (`my_audio`).

#### 3. **Playback Speed Control**

```javascript
const audio = document.querySelector('#my_audio');
const playbackrate = document.querySelector('#pbrate');
const display = document.querySelector('.speedcontrolcontainer span');

// Apply saved playback rate (if any)
const savedSpeed = window.localStorage.pbspeed;
if (savedSpeed) {
  audio.playbackRate = savedSpeed;
  playbackrate.value = savedSpeed;
}

// Display the playback rate as a percentage
const displayRate = () => display.innerText = `${Math.round(audio.playbackRate * 100)}%`;
displayRate();

// Update playback rate on change and store in localStorage
playbackrate.addEventListener('input', () => {
  audio.playbackRate = playbackrate.value;
  displayRate();
  window.localStorage.pbspeed = playbackrate.value;
});
```

* **Playback Rate Adjustment**:

  * The playback rate can be adjusted using the range input (`#pbrate`). The current playback speed is displayed as a percentage inside the `<span>`.
  * **`localStorage`**: The chosen speed is saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so it persists across page reloads.
  * The playback rate is updated when the user moves the range slider. The new value is saved in `localStorage` and used for future sessions.

### **External Libraries**

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
```

* **jQuery**: This script loads the latest version of jQuery to handle the fade-out effect for the countdown timer. It's used for DOM manipulation, but the rest of the functionality is done in vanilla JavaScript.

---

### **Important Considerations**

* **Autoplay Restrictions**: Many modern browsers block autoplay of audio or video content with sound. You may need to account for these restrictions depending on the environment in which this code will run.
* **LocalStorage Persistence**: The playback rate is saved in `localStorage`, which persists even after page reloads. However, it's cleared if the browser cache is cleared or if the user opens the page in a new incognito window.
